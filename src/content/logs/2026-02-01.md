Software development is shifting. The interface part, specifically. Been using Conductor long enough now to notice: neither the terminal nor the editor is the right fit for what's coming. They're built for single-project thinking. One window, one context, one linear flow.

Multiple agents? Different story. Running three, four threads at once—not just open tabs, actual parallel work streams—you need a different mental model. And I'm getting there. My job already trains me for this: multiple threads, continuous loops, constant switching. Turns out that maps nicely to orchestrating agents. When one's blocked, spin up another. When that one's waiting on input, shift to the third.

But I still have gaps. Use cases where I should spawn multiple agents? Blank. I know it's possible. I know it's useful. I just can't see it yet. The interface change made it obvious, though. Conductor pulled me out of the single-project default. One session per repo, one task at a time—that whole paradigm just dissolved. And once you see that, you can't unsee it. Building products will look different. Has to.
