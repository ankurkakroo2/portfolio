Oh, I'm shit scared of Opus and even Codex High and Xhigh. Today I gave a very hairy problem to GPT 5.2 Codex. It was tricky and actually had got handovered from GLM 4.7 to Opus and eventually to 5.2 codex.

I was trying to set up a proxy for my Gemini subscription so that you can use it with Claude Code because I have realized that harness is very important, and I like Claude Code's harness. I think it just makes the models perform better. But you are just seeing the thinking tokens and how these very large models "think" and looking at it on your screen seeing multiple moments of brilliance and seeing how they latched on to a new and a completely different thread which eventually revealed a solution is actually kind of scary and crazy.

Today I had also the longest run that I had to longest run for any model that I ran across last many months since I've been using models LLMs heavily for coding and it ran for more than an hour and I was intrigued looking at it following through. And it was mesmerizing to say the least.

This is what is currently in progress here. Here is the repo - [`claudecode-antigravity-auth`](https://github.com/ankurkakroo2/claudecode-antigravity-auth) (still in progress) Yeah, mostly I think people will benefit from this as well because for the mere mortals like me, I have seen my tendency is to kind of ration models from different providers but I'm just trying to unify the user experience for myself and sticking to Claude Code.
