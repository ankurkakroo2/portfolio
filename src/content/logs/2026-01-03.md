This week I focused on improving our deployment pipeline by implementing automated rollback mechanisms. The team noticed a 40% reduction in incident response time, which has been a huge win for our on-call engineers.

I also spent time mentoring two junior engineers on distributed systems architecture. We built a toy consensus algorithm implementation to understand Raft better. There's something deeply satisfying about watching concepts click for someone else.

Weekend project: Started experimenting with Rust for a CLI tool that helps analyze deployment metrics. The borrow checker is both frustrating and enlightening. Coming from TypeScript, it's making me rethink how I approach state management.
