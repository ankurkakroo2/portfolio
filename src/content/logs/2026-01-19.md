Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT 5.2 XHigh are really, really good. Tried the Ralph Wingham technique today, worked really well. Built a boring app but had a lot of components, so good stress test.

GLM 4.7 is surprising me. Somewhere around Sonnet thinking model level, but then it gives you these moments where it feels like Opus 4.5. The limits are extremely generous. Burned around 300 million tokens in a few hours.

Yesterday night bought an Arduino R4 microcontroller. Ran some experiments. Fun to work with my kid on it and program crazy stuff. Worried he's too small and will ruin everything, but thinking of interesting uses and how to build on top of it.

The experiments were small, but gave me a peek at what's possible. I've worked with embedded systems before, it's tedious. Writing all that code, testing it, etc. But this was seamless. Just told the agent what to do and it interfaced and loaded the program into the microcontroller directly. Rapidly did 4-5 experiments. Pretty fun ones.

Wild times.
