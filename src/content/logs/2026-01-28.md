heading: Interfaces Aren't Ready Yet

Wanted to talk about interfaces. Interfaces of tomorrow, really. I started with this belief that the terminal is the right interface. Still think it might be the most fundamental unit of orchestrating an agent. But using multiple agents across multiple repositories? It's clear the terminal might not be the most efficient user experience for the future. Would you even call that an editor? Agent orchestration will happen in user experiences that are very different from what we have now.

Tools like Conductor, Commander. They give us a peek. Been using Conductor heavily. Nice tool. The design of the software itself lets me multitask in a way I couldn't before. Subtle difference in how the UI works, but it changed my workflow. More efficient at hopping between tasks instead of moving terminal window by terminal window, figuring out which session is which. Turns out interface design matters more than I thought.

Tried Kimi K2.5 thinking model this week. Gave it a vague, UI-heavy problem just to see what happens. Impressed. Actually handled it well. Way better than GLM 4.7 on the same kind of thing. Then I had it generate a logo and we iterated on it naturally, back and forth, refining. That's where NanoBanana breaks down: they cache so aggressively you can't iterate. Probably optimizing for cost but it kills the flow. Open source models are going to eat here. They already are.

Office stuff ramped up. Product launch coming, so less time for personal repos. But I'm running two or three agents at work now, solving actual problems we hit daily. Real problems, not toy examples. They're shaping up nicely. Started contributing to internal agent tooling too because once you see what's possible, you can't unsee it. You just start building.

Hectic week. But the kind of hectic that's worth it.
