The world is changing and it's changing fast. Next five to ten years? Era of builders. Building has never been more exciting, truth be told. AI agents at your disposal can do almost any job. I'm getting more done than ever, given the time I have.

But limits. Great models consume limits very, very quickly. Spent the whole day figuring out subscription permutations—trying to get bang for buck, decent limits. Tried everything. Opus. Cursor. Claude code. Antigravity. Different combinations, different stacks.

Had this revelation, practically experienced it: harness matters. Possibly more than the model itself. Been using GLM 4.7 with opencode. Not great. Proxied it through Claude Code and suddenly it's good—like 40% better capability just from changing the harness. Set it up at [`claude-code-glm-setup`](https://github.com/ankurkakroo2/claude-code-glm-setup) if you want to follow that rabbit hole.

Now I've got Google's AI Pro subscription too. Multiple models, solid pricing. Trying to proxy it through Google's auth but still get model access into Claude Code because I've started appreciating how good the harness actually is. And honestly? Anthropic's models, especially Opus—every time there's a hairy problem, Opus surprises me. Can't use it continuously, limits being limits, but when it counts, it delivers.

Other thing I'm thinking about: need more stimulus. More reasons to build things to explore. Wondering if I should get some hardware to hack on because the last thing I want to do with these models is build websites. Websites are easy—I can do those myself. Typical software engineering, backend, whatever? Not fun unless there's a great product idea behind it. Complex visualizations are fun, sure, but watching models struggle in unfamiliar environments is where you actually learn. Like when I was working with Kindle stuff—different territory, you learn way more about the model, the tools, the whole stack.

Exciting times ahead. Really enjoying this phase. Equally nervous about how fast it's all moving.
