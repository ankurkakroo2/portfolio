The agent shift is different. I've said this before, but it keeps getting more true the more I sit in it. The cursor era was AI-as-assistant. A really smart autocomplete. A pair programmer that never got tired. That was one thing. This is another. Agents don't just assist. They execute. And that changes the relationship entirely, not just with the tools but with the work itself.

What's started becoming clear is that you can't just point a company at agents and say "go." The technology isn't the hard part. Every company has a different stack, different tools, different ways engineers already work. The real question isn't "which AI tools are best." It's "what does a workflow that actually holds together look like for *us*?" And that's a harder question. You have to figure out how the pieces stitch. How the agent fits into the existing toolchain without creating a parallel universe nobody maintains. How you get from a promising demo to something the whole team is actually using every day. Budget is a real thing, sure, but it's usually not the wall. The wall is coherence.

And that's before you get to the human side. Some people get it immediately. Others are suspicious. Not of AI, but of the implication that the way they've worked for ten years might need to change. That's not resistance to technology. That's a reasonable response to uncertainty. So now you're navigating both: the org mechanics and the culture shift. At the same time. With no playbook.

The snowball metaphor is the right one though. Before it starts rolling, the only thing that works is a real leap. Top-down mandate, bottom-up energy, both at once. Neither alone is enough. Top-down without bottom-up buy-in gives you a compliance exercise. Nobody actually changes how they work. Bottom-up without top-down support hits budget and access walls immediately and dies there. It's not a nice-to-have combination. It's load-bearing. The snowball needs both hands.

The uncomfortable truth is that companies doing this well right now aren't being thoughtful about it. They're being aggressive. Decisions that used to take a quarter are being made in a week. Some of those decisions are wrong. That's fine. The alternative (deliberate, consensus-driven, committee-approved AI adoption) is just structured latency. By the time you've figured out the perfect workflow, the floor has moved again.
