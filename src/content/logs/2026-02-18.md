The agent shift is different. I've said this before—but it keeps getting more true the more I sit in it. The cursor era was AI-as-assistant. A really smart autocomplete. A pair programmer that never got tired. That was one thing. This is another. Agents don't just assist. They execute. And that changes the relationship entirely, not just with the tools but with the work itself.

What's started becoming clear is that you can't just point a company at agents and say "go." The technology isn't the hard part. Somewhere in the middle of trying to actually drive AI-first culture at a company, I hit the real constraint: it's not capability, it's compatibility. What does an AI-first workflow even look like for *us*, with *our* stack, *our* engineers, *our* budget approval cycles? Engineers don't just need access to tools. They need the tools to be sanctioned, scoped, funded, understood by legal, approved by someone three layers up. By the time that's done, the tool has shipped a new version and the evaluation starts over.

And that's before you get to the human side. Some people get it immediately. Others are suspicious—not of AI, but of the implication that the way they've worked for ten years might need to change. That's not resistance to technology. That's a reasonable response to uncertainty. So now you're navigating both: the org mechanics and the culture shift. At the same time. With no playbook.

The snowball metaphor is the right one though. Before it starts rolling, the only thing that works is a real leap—top-down mandate, bottom-up energy, both at once. Neither alone is enough. Top-down without bottom-up buy-in gives you a compliance exercise. Nobody actually changes how they work. Bottom-up without top-down support hits budget and access walls immediately and dies there. It's not a nice-to-have combination. It's load-bearing. The snowball needs both hands.

The uncomfortable truth is that companies doing this well right now aren't being thoughtful about it. They're being aggressive. Decisions that used to take a quarter are being made in a week. Some of those decisions are wrong. That's fine. The alternative—deliberate, consensus-driven, committee-approved AI adoption—is just structured latency. By the time you've figured out the perfect workflow, the floor has moved again.
