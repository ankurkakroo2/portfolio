heading: Two Camps, Same Tool
---
There's a split I keep noticing. Not between people who use AI and people who don't. It's between people who ask "how do I do this faster?" and people asking "what can I do now that I couldn't do before?" Two camps. Same tool. Completely different orientation.

The optimizers aren't wrong. The gains are real. Writing faster, shipping features at higher velocity, summarizing what took hours in seconds. Useful, all of it. But if that's the entire frame, something's getting missed. Because you don't get exponential from a 2x workflow. You get 2x. Which is fine. But not the thing.

The actual unlock is in the things that used to cost too much. Too slow, too complex, required too many people to coordinate, felt impossible to attempt alone. Those problems didn't just get cheaper. They changed category. Something that was cost-infinity is now near-zero. And that math breaks in ways that are hard to think clearly about until you're inside it.

I started asking myself mid-task: *am I optimizing something, or operating in something new?* Simple question. Cuts every time. Because the honest answer is almost always: optimization. Habit is sticky. The shape of old work haunts the new work. You pick up a power tool and reach for the same nail.

What's strange is that AI seems to be doing the stretching actively. You build something in a weekend that would've taken a quarter, and something recalibrates. You start asking "wait, what else was I not even trying because it seemed too big?" That shift. That's not a productivity number. It's the ambition adjusting in real time. The ceiling going somewhere you can't fully see yet.

Pretty exciting times to be navigating the map while it's still being drawn.
