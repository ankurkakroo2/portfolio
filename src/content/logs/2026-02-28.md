heading: Two Camps, Same Tool
---
There's a split I keep noticing. Not between people who use AI and people who don't. It's between people who ask "how do I do this faster?" and people asking "what can I do now that I couldn't do before?" Two camps. Same tool. Completely different orientation.

The optimizers aren't wrong. Real gains, all of them. But optimization is bounded by the shape of the thing being optimized. Speed up the existing process, you get a faster version of the existing process. The constraints scale proportionally. The ceiling stays put.

What's actually different here is that the *architecture* of work breaks. When cost collapses from impossible to near-zero, it's not just cheaper. It's a different category of problem entirely. Something that required a coordinated team, six months of planning, and organizational alignment is now a weekend solo project. That shift doesn't make the old process faster. It makes the old process *wrong*. Because those processes weren't designed arbitrarily. They were designed around constraints that no longer exist. Running them through AI to save some hours is the least interesting thing you could do. The right move is to throw them out and rebuild from what's actually true now.

But almost nobody does this. Habit is sticky. The shape of old work haunts new work. You pick up a power tool and instinctively reach for the same nail. Optimization wins by default—not because it's the better choice, but because rethinking from scratch requires admitting that a lot of what you've been doing was load-bearing on limitations, not on intent. That's uncomfortable. So the exponential sits there, mostly unclaimed.

What's strange is that AI seems to be doing the stretching actively. You build something in a weekend that would've taken a quarter, and something recalibrates. You start asking "wait, what else was I not even trying because it seemed too big?" That shift. That's not a productivity number. It's the ambition adjusting in real time. The ceiling going somewhere you can't fully see yet.

Pretty exciting times to be navigating the map while it's still being drawn.
