Big milestone this week: our new API gateway went live in production. Six months of planning, building, and testing all came together. The cutover was surprisingly smooth, thanks to extensive feature flagging and gradual rollout. Only a handful of minor issues that were quickly patched.

Led a retrospective on the project with the team. Key learnings: investing in good local development environments pays dividends, and writing migration guides for internal teams is just as important as external documentation.

On the personal front, I've been reading "Staff Engineer: Leadership Beyond the Management Track" by Will Larson. Lots of resonant ideas about technical leadership and organizational impact. Thinking about how to apply some of these concepts to our team structure.
