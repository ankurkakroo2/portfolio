Model testing week. Ran GLM 4.7, Opus, Gemini 3 Pro, GPT 5.2 Codex through their paces. GLM's solid for straight coding but ask it to handle design or something genuinely complex? Falls apart. Design work, I keep reaching for Opus. Frontend skill loaded up, Opus just gets it. Gemini 3 Pro edges ahead slightly on pure design intuition, but pair Opus with that frontend skill and it's a different beast. GLM has the skill too but doesn't execute. So I'm back to Anthropic models every time.

GPT 5.2 Codex is still the choice for gnarly, long-running problems. Just accept that it's slow and move on.

Then I stumbled into Remotion. The MCP server that generates videos. Took my portfolio, fed it through, 20 minutes later had this slick video artifact. Use case unclear but the possibilities are obvious. There's a 0-to-1 product at work where this could create some genuinely cool stuff. Worth exploring.

Second discovery: [pencil.dev](https://pencil.dev). Open canvas, hooks into Claude Code, any coding tool really. You brainstorm with Opus, it generates real-time visual samples while you're thinking. Feels like having a designer sitting next to you. Iterate, discard, refine, narrow it down. Then hand the polished plan to Opus to finish functionality. Close the loop. No friction.

What hit me is there's no ceiling anymore. You can stretch your imagination as far as it goes and actually build the thing. The oyster metaphor is overused but accurate here. The world's wide open. These tools just keep revealing what's possible. Humbling, honestly. Next few months should be interesting.
