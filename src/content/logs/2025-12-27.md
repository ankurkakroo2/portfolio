Wrapped up Q4 planning with the leadership team this week. We're doubling down on platform reliability in Q1, which means more investment in observability tooling and chaos engineering practices. Excited to see where this takes us.

Spent some time reviewing our interview process. We've been growing fast, and I want to make sure we're still hiring for the right traits: curiosity, ownership, and the ability to learn quickly. Updated our technical assessment to focus less on algorithm trivia and more on real-world problem solving.

Also shipped a small but impactful feature: automatic tagging of deployments with Jira tickets. This has made our post-mortems so much easier to trace back to the original context.
