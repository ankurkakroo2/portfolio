Mobile dev problem? Finally solved. Like, actually solved. Built a shell script that auto-configures everything—Cursor, Termius, remote SSH, the works. Called it [ClaudeGo](https://github.com/ankurkakroo2/claudeGo). One command and you're set up. No more "wait let me fix my environment" nonsense. Just works.

Then hit a wall. Different problem. Memory across sessions? Doesn't exist. You spin up a new Claude Code session, you start from scratch. Every. Single. Time. Tried Mem0—[wrote a setup guide](https://github.com/ankurkakroo2/memory-setup-claude)—but honestly? Felt heavy. Then I was at the airport (traveling back from Bangalore), stuck in that dopamine loop of optimizing my agent ecosystem (again), and found [Spec Story](https://specstory.com/). Treats context as empty files. Simple. Elegant. Exactly what I needed.

Integrated it into my YOLO alias. Now every Claude session auto-sets up Spec Story. Context persists. Files don't vanish. I'm not nervous anymore. Cloud-based solutions exist, sure, but filesystem-based? For now? Perfect. Sometimes the simple answer is the right answer.

Then something weird happened. Showed my wife how I fixed my portfolio site—through my phone, live, in front of her. Made a couple of changes. Worked perfectly. She watched. But I don't think it hit her yet. Like, *really* hit her. We're sitting on a slippery slope. The era of builders is here. Right now. You can build things from your phone while sitting on a couch. The world is changing *fast*. And I don't think most people realize how fast.

I'm pushing this at work too. Telling people: use Claude Code. Use agentic tools. Stop doing things manually. Some get it. Some don't yet. But they will.

Good last few days. Kept building. Kept shipping. That's the only way forward. Build. Push. Repeat.
