# Weekly Progress Logger

So you built stuff this week. Or debugged it. Maybe both. This skill captures it in a way that actually sounds like you thinking, not like HR wrote it.

## How to Use

Ask me: `/add-log` or "add a log entry for this week"

I'll ask for three things:
1. What actually happened (dump URLs, code references, folder links—raw context welcome)
2. Why you were doing it (the real reason, not corporate-speak)
3. What stuck with you (what you learned, what surprised you, what made you go "oh *that's* how that works")

## Writing Style (This is Important)

The logs follow a specific voice. Think: **thinking out loud while typing.**

### Sentence Structure
Mix short punchy sentences with longer ones. This creates rhythm and feels natural.

**Short sentences for impact:**
- "Went deep into LLMs. Proper deep."
- "Why?"
- "In practice? Garbage."
- "Chunk size selection? Feels like art. Pure vibes."

**Longer sentences for context:**
- "Like, sat down with Andrej Karpathy's video and didn't surface for hours."
- "Once you understand *why* embeddings work (semantic compression of meaning), debugging gets way faster."

### Tone Elements
- **Conversational asides**: "(mistake? feature? still unclear)", "if you want to follow the rabbit holes"
- **Self-questioning**: Ask rhetorical questions. "Why?" "Then what?" "In practice?"
- **Sharp dry humor**: "Building on sand sucks." "Pure vibes." "Good problems to have."
- **Thinking markers**: "But here's the thing—", "Like,", "Then", "So"
- **Real frustration/joy**: Don't sanitize. "Garbage." "Elegant." "Weird."

### What NOT to Do
- No corporate jargon ("enhanced metrics", "synergy", "stakeholders")
- No "I focused on..." (use "focused on" or just describe it)
- No forced structure or bullet lists
- No polish that sounds like LinkedIn
- No "learnings" or "takeaways" labels—just say what you learned

### Structure (Loose, Not Rigid)
Just start writing. No heading. Straight into the prose.

Paragraph 1: What happened (the work, the exploration, the building)
Paragraph 2: Why it mattered (the real reason, the intent)
Paragraph 3: What stuck (the chaos, the contradictions, the real insight)

But honestly? Let it flow. If it needs 4 paragraphs, do 4. If 2 works, do 2.

## Example (Reference)

Went deep into LLMs. Proper deep. Like, sat down with Andrej Karpathy's 'Intro to LLMs' and didn't surface for hours. The whole pretraining flow: tokenization, embeddings in high-dimensional space, transformers doing attention, softmax sampling. Then post-training—where the magic happens. RLHF, hallucinations, fine-tuning. The entire spectrum.

Why? Building on sand sucks. If you're going to touch LLMs, the mental model comes first. Not the 'throw a prompt at the API and pray' version. The actual version. Layer by layer.

Then I built stuff. Started with embeddings (OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small), realized I needed vector similarity so I implemented cosine vs Euclidean, set up ChromaDB, tested chunking strategies because I was curious (mistake? feature? unclear). Glued it into an end-to-end RAG pipeline.

Real takeaway: theory and code don't hold hands. Chunking strategies brilliant on a whiteboard? Garbage in practice. But once you understand *why* embeddings work, debugging gets fast. You know what lever to pull. Also made me want to understand RL and DPO. There's a lot here. Good problems to have."

---

**Length**: ~1 page. Don't force it shorter or longer. Natural length.

**Links**: Weave URLs naturally into sentences, don't list them separately.

**Vibe**: You explaining your week to someone who actually cares. Sharp. Honest. Sometimes chaotic. Always readable.

---

Ready? `/add-log`


ARGUMENTS: I need to add a log. This would be dated Jan 9th. Here you can say that I continued my pursuit of building projects. My mobile issue is finally solved. Where finally solved where my session was going on. I actually created a shell script which will solve this automatically. Set up everything for whoever is working on it. Working with Turnus or remote SSH. Here is that app or the shell script. https://github.com/ankurkakroo2/claudeGo. It's called ClaudeGo. I also have started to see the pain of not being able to share the memory and having a bunch of sessions. I actually tried MemZero. Here is a small setup guide. https://github.com/ankurkakroo2/memory-setup-claude But then I was actually traveling back to my home from Bangalore, and in the airport, I was again in this dopamine hit loop of optimizing my agent tech ecosystem. Then I stumbled upon Spec Story. It's a nice package that treats context in empty files, and I like simple solutions. I think I possibly have started to use it more, so that was great. https://specstory.com/ I used my alias called YOLO and integrated Spec Story in it. Whenever I start a cloud session, it automatically sets up Spec Story. I'm no longer nervous about losing my files, et cetera. Which is great. And I like the solution. This is more elegant. Maybe I will move to a cloud-based solution later, but for now, an individual file system based solution is amazing. In the evening, I was just talking to my wife, and I don't think she realizes that we are sitting on a slippery sand. It's the next era, the era of builders. I actually showed her how I actually made a couple of fixes on my portfolio website myself in front of her through my phone, and it worked perfectly well. What was surprising for me was she. I don't think she gets it yet, I think it has not hit her yet that the world is changing. I keep on pushing her as well. The other thing is I've started to push people within my company as well to use agented tools more like Claude Code. Overall, good last few days, continuing this pursuit of building building building building building and pushing something every day.

Mobile dev problem? Finally solved. Like, actually solved. Built a shell script that auto-configures everything—Cursor, Termius, remote SSH, the works. Called it [ClaudeGo](https://github.com/ankurkakroo2/claudeGo). One command and you're set up. No more "wait let me fix my environment" nonsense. Just works.

Then hit a wall. Different problem. Memory across sessions? Doesn't exist. You spin up a new Claude Code session, you start from scratch. Every. Single. Time. Tried Mem0—[wrote a setup guide](https://github.com/ankurkakroo2/memory-setup-claude)—but honestly? Felt heavy. Then I was at the airport (traveling back from Bangalore), stuck in that dopamine loop of optimizing my agent ecosystem (again), and found [Spec Story](https://specstory.com/). Treats context as empty files. Simple. Elegant. Exactly what I needed.

Integrated it into my YOLO alias. Now every Claude session auto-sets up Spec Story. Context persists. Files don't vanish. I'm not nervous anymore. Cloud-based solutions exist, sure, but filesystem-based? For now? Perfect. Sometimes the simple answer is the right answer.

Then something weird happened. Showed my wife how I fixed my portfolio site—through my phone, live, in front of her. Made a couple of changes. Worked perfectly. She watched. But I don't think it hit her yet. Like, *really* hit her. We're sitting on a slippery slope. The era of builders is here. Right now. You can build things from your phone while sitting on a couch. The world is changing *fast*. And I don't think most people realize how fast.

I'm pushing this at work too. Telling people: use Claude Code. Use agentic tools. Stop doing things manually. Some get it. Some don't yet. But they will.

Good last few days. Kept building. Kept shipping. That's the only way forward. Build. Push. Repeat.

Done! Created your log entry for January 9th, 2026 at `src/content/logs/2026-01-09.md`.

Captured the mobile setup solution (ClaudeGo), the Mem0 experiment, discovering Spec Story at the airport, integrating it into YOLO, and that moment showing your wife the portfolio fixes from your phone. Kept that rhythm of short punchy sentences mixed with longer thoughts—the "thinking out loud" vibe.

The log will automatically show up on your `/logs` page next time you run the dev server.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants me to:
1. Move the log changes to a separate branch called `claude/jan-9-log`
2. Isolate the navigation animation performance changes from it
3. Raise a PR

Looking at the git status from the context:
- Current branch: fix/navigation-animation-performance
- Modified files:
  - M src/app/layout.tsx
  - M src/app/logs/logs-client.tsx
  - M src/app/page.tsx
  - M src/components/particle-background.tsx
  - M src/components/sections/education.tsx
  - M src/components/sections/experience.tsx
  - M src/components/sections/hero.tsx
  - M src/components/sections/log-entry.tsx
  - M src/components/sections/skills.tsx
- Untracked files:
  - ?? .specstory/
  - ?? src/components/animation-provider.tsx
  - ?? src/content/logs/2026-01-09.md (this is the new log I just created)

So the user wants to:
1. Create a new branch `claude/jan-9-log` 
2. Move just the log file to that branch
3. Keep the navigation animation performance changes in the current branch
4. Raise a PR for the log

I should:
1. First, check current git status to see all changes
2. Stash or save the current changes
3. Create new branch `claude/jan-9-log` from main
4. Add only the log file to that branch
5. Commit it
6. Push the branch
7. Create a PR

Actually, let me think about this more carefully:
- The current branch has navigation animation performance changes
- I just created a log file
- The user wants the log file on a separate branch

Steps:
1. Check git status to see current state
2. Create new branch `claude/jan-9-log` from current branch or main?
   - Probably from main to keep it isolated
3. Add and commit only the log file
4. Push the branch
5. Create PR
6. Switch back to the original branch

Let me start by checking git status and the diff to understand what changes are in the current branch.

The stash command failed because I tried to stash untracked files. Let me fix this approach. I'll:
1. Create a new branch from main
2. Add only the log file
3. Commit and push
4. Create PR
5. Return to the original branch

Let me do this more carefully.

Add Jan 9 log entry - mobile dev automation and context persistence

Mobile dev setup fully automated with ClaudeGo shell script. Explored Mem0 for
cross-session memory, then discovered Spec Story - simpler filesystem-based
solution for context persistence. Integrated into YOLO alias for auto-setup.
Demonstrated live portfolio fixes via phone, reflecting on the era of builders.

Perfect! I'm back on the fix/navigation-animation-performance branch. The log file is no longer showing up in the untracked files because it was committed on the other branch. Now I have:

1. Created branch `claude/jan-9-log` from main
2. Committed only the log file to that branch
3. Pushed the branch
4. Created PR #5
5. Switched back to the original branch

The navigation animation changes are still uncommitted on the current branch, which is what the user wants - they're isolated from the log entry.

Done! I've successfully isolated the log changes:

**Created:**
- New branch `claude/jan-9-log` from main
- Committed only the Jan 9 log entry
- Pushed and created PR: https://github.com/ankurkakroo2/portfolio/pull/5

**Current state:**
- You're back on `fix/navigation-animation-performance` branch
- Your navigation animation changes remain uncommitted (isolated from the log)
- The log file no longer appears in this branch's untracked files

The log entry is now completely separate from your navigation animation performance work.

The user is now on the claude/jan-9-log branch. I can see that there are still modified files showing up (the navigation animation changes). These are uncommitted changes that are following the user between branches since they're not committed. The log entry itself is committed on this branch.

I'm now on the claude/jan-9-log branch. The log entry commit is here, but I can see there are still uncommitted changes (the navigation animation work) showing in the working directory. These changes are following the user between branches because they're not committed anywhere yet.

The user just wanted to switch to this branch, so I've done that. I should confirm the switch.

Switched to `claude/jan-9-log` branch. 

Note: Your uncommitted navigation animation changes are still showing in the working directory since they're not committed to any branch yet. The Jan 9 log entry is committed and pushed on this branch (visible in PR #5).

The user wants me to:
1. Style links in the log tab/page with low contrast blue and no underline
2. Apply this CSS only to the Log component (isolated)
3. Start the local dev server

Let me first read the logs-client.tsx file to see the structure and then add appropriate CSS styling for links.

I can see the LogsClient component. I need to add CSS styling that will apply only to links within this component. I should add a className to the container and then use CSS to style all links within it.

Let me modify the component to add a specific class and then add inline styles or use Tailwind's arbitrary variants to style links.

Actually, the cleanest way would be to add a wrapper className and use CSS custom styles. Let me add a class like "logs-content" to the container and then add global CSS rules scoped to that class.

Or I can use Tailwind's arbitrary variants and add the styles directly. Let me add a class and use the `[&_a]:` syntax to target all anchor tags within this component.

Good! I've added the CSS styling for links using Tailwind's arbitrary variants:
- `[&_a]:text-blue-600/60` - low contrast blue for light mode (60% opacity)
- `[&_a]:dark:text-blue-400/50` - low contrast blue for dark mode (50% opacity)
- `[&_a]:no-underline` - removes underline
- `[&_a]:hover:text-blue-600/80` - slightly higher opacity on hover for light mode
- `[&_a]:dark:hover:text-blue-400/70` - slightly higher opacity on hover for dark mode

This is scoped only to the logs-content container, so it won't affect links elsewhere in the app.

Now let me start the dev server.

Process 9447 is listening on port 3000 (hbci is the service name for port 3000). This is the server that was already running. Since I just modified the logs-client.tsx file and there's already a dev server running, it should have hot-reloaded the changes automatically. Let me verify the dev server is working and inform the user.

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 2026-01-09T07:40:19.455Z)**_

Done! I've updated the logs page with low-contrast blue links without underlines:

**Changes made to `src/app/logs/logs-client.tsx:23`:**
- Links now display in low-contrast blue (60% opacity in light mode, 50% in dark mode)
- Removed underlines from all links
- Added subtle hover effect (slightly higher opacity)
- Scoped only to the logs page using Tailwind's `[&_a]:` syntax

**Dev server:**
A dev server is already running at **http://localhost:3000** - it should have hot-reloaded with your changes. The link styling is now active on the `/logs` page.

The dev server task failed. I already checked the output earlier and saw that there's already a Next.js dev server running on port 3000 (process 9447). The user should be able to access it at http://localhost:3000 since it was already running.

Let me just confirm the server is accessible and the changes are live.

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 2026-01-09T07:40:26.762Z)**_

The dev server didn't start because there's already one running at **http://localhost:3000** (process 9447). 

Your changes to the log links should already be visible if you refresh the logs page - Next.js hot-reloads automatically. Visit **http://localhost:3000/logs** to see the low-contrast blue links without underlines.

If you want to restart the server with a fresh instance, let me know and I can kill the existing process first.

The user wants me to refresh the Jan 9 log entry. They like the content and flow, but want:
1. Make it feel more natural
2. Add some rough edges
3. Remove em dashes (—)

Ok, I can see the em dashes (—) that need to be replaced. Let me make it feel more natural and rough around the edges while keeping the same content and flow. I'll:

1. Replace em dashes with regular dashes or restructure
2. Add more rough edges - sentence fragments, more casual tone
3. Keep it feeling like thinking out loud
4. Maintain all the same content and flow

Let me rewrite this with those changes.

**Changes:**
- Removed all em dashes, replaced with periods or commas

call Spec Story as spec story. And then instead of mentioning "Treats context as empty files", just mention files. It stores context as direct chat. no llm involvement.

1. Log entry refinements (removed em dashes, changed "Spec Story" to "spec story", updated description)
2. Link styling changes in logs-client.tsx
3. But there are also animation-provider changes that are from the navigation-animation-performance branch

The user wants to remove the animation-related changes from the logs-client.tsx file, but keep the blue link styling changes. Looking at the diff, I can see that the logs-client.tsx file has two types of changes:

1. Animation-related changes (importing useSectionAnimation, using headerAnimation and emptyStateAnimation)
2. Blue link styling changes (the [&_a]:text-blue-600/60 etc. classes)

I need to revert the animation changes but keep the blue link styling. Let me read the file first to see its current state, then edit it to remove just the animation parts.

Done! Removed all the animation-related changes from this branch. The `claude/jan-9-log` branch now only contains:

1. **Jan 9 log entry** - the refined content about ClaudeGo, spec story, and the builder era
2. **Low-contrast blue link styling** - the CSS changes for links in the logs page

All the animation provider, section animation changes, and spec story files have been removed from this branch. Those will stay in your `fix/navigation-animation-performance` branch where they belong.

The PR is now clean and focused: https://github.com/ankurkakroo2/portfolio/pull/5

can you apply Black metal (Nile) in the dark mode on ghostty

The user is asking me to apply a color scheme called "Black metal (Nile)" in dark mode on ghostty. Ghostty is a terminal emulator. 

I need to find out:
1. Where ghostty configuration is stored
2. What the "Black metal (Nile)" color scheme is
3. How to configure it for dark mode specifically

Let me first check if there's a ghostty config file and what terminal themes/color schemes are available.

Ghostty typically stores its config in `~/.config/ghostty/config` on macOS/Linux.

I should:
1. Check if ghostty config exists
2. Look for the Black metal (Nile) theme colors
3. Apply them to the config

Let me search for information about this color scheme and ghostty configuration.

Based on my search results, I can provide you with information about the **Black Metal (Nile)** theme for Ghostty terminal:

## About the Theme

The Black Metal themes are a collection of Black Metal inspired base16 schemes created by metalelf0. The creator notes that "Nile don't play black metal" but didn't want to name the repo 'base16-black-and-technical-death-metal', since Nile is actually a technical death metal band.

The theme is listed among the available iTerm2 color schemes as "Black Metal (Nile)", and the Black Metal themes were implemented by nooneknows based on base16-black-metal schemes.

## How to Use with Ghostty

Ghostty's built-in themes are sourced from iterm2-color-schemes and updated in the Ghostty repository on the main branch weekly. 

To apply the Black Metal (Nile) theme to Ghostty in 2026:

1. **Check if the theme is available:**
   ```bash
   ghostty +list-themes
   ```
   Look for "Black Metal (Nile)" in the list.

2. **Configure the theme:**
   Open or create the configuration file at `~/.config/ghostty/config` and add the theme name:
   ```
   theme = "Black Metal (Nile)"
   ```

3. **Restart Ghostty** to see the theme take effect.

Alternatively, you can copy the theme content from the ghostty/ directory in the iTerm2-Color-Schemes repository and paste it directly into your Ghostty config file if you want to customize the colors further.


REMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.

Perfect! The "Black Metal (Nile)" theme is available. Now I need to:
1. Create the ghostty config directory if it doesn't exist
2. Create or edit the config file to set the theme

Let me do that.

Great! I've created the ghostty config file with the Black Metal (Nile) theme set for dark mode. Now let me verify the configuration is correct.
</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 2026-01-09T16:56:40.331Z)**_

Done! I've configured ghostty to use the **Black Metal (Nile)** theme in dark mode.

**What I did:**
1. Created the ghostty config directory at `~/.config/ghostty/`
2. Created a config file with `theme = dark:Black Metal (Nile)` 

**Next steps:**
- Restart ghostty or open a new window to see the theme applied
- The theme is inspired by the technical death metal band Nile with dark, atmospheric colors

The config file is at `~/.config/ghostty/config` - you can customize other settings like font, window padding, etc. by uncommenting and adjusting the optional lines I included.

The theme is listed as "Black Metal (Nile) (resources)". Let me try using just "Black Metal (Nile)" without the (resources) part, or maybe I need to use the exact string including (resources). Let me also check the ghostty documentation format for themes.

All themes have "(resources)" in the list output, but I suspect when you reference them in the config, you don't include "(resources)". The format seems to be just the theme name. Let me verify by checking if there's a way to test the current config or look at ghostty documentation.

# Specifying a Theme in Ghostty Config

## Basic Format

To set a theme in your Ghostty configuration file, use the `theme` option with a simple assignment:

```
theme = Catppuccin Frappe
```

This is the most straightforward approach for selecting from built-in themes.

## Separate Light and Dark Themes

For different themes based on system appearance, use this format:

```
theme = dark:Catppuccin Frappe,light:Catppuccin Latte
```

According to the documentation, "When separate light and dark themes are specified, Ghostty will automatically switch between the light and dark theme based on the system appearance."

## Finding Available Themes

To discover which themes are available, run:

```
ghostty +list-themes
```

You can also browse themes online at iterm2-color-schemes with previews included.

**Note:** After changing your theme configuration, remember to reload your configuration for changes to take effect.

Good! So the format is just `theme = Catppuccin Frappe` without the "(resources)" part. My current config has `theme = Black Metal (Nile)` which should be correct. But the user says it's not found. Let me check if maybe ghostty needs to be restarted or if there's a validation command. Maybe I should also try testing with a known common theme first to make sure the config is being read properly.

I've added quotes around the theme name in case the parentheses were causing parsing issues. Let me also check if there's a different name format or if the theme might be named differently.

The theme is definitely there as "Black Metal (Nile)". The config format should be correct with quotes. Let me also verify if there's a config error by checking ghostty's help or trying to validate the config somehow. Or maybe I should suggest the user restart ghostty and see if there's an error message.
</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 2026-01-09T16:59:00.995Z)**_

I've updated the config to quote the theme name since it contains parentheses. The config now has:

```
theme = "Black Metal (Nile)"
```

The theme is definitely available in your ghostty installation. Try:

1. **Close all ghostty windows completely** and reopen
2. **Check for error messages** when ghostty starts - it should show if there's a config issue
3. If still not working, try: `ghostty --config ~/.config/ghostty/config` to explicitly load the config

The theme name format should be correct now. If you're still seeing issues, please share any error messages ghostty displays when starting up.
