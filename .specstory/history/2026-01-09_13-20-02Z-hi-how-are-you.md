<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user is greeting me with "hi how are you". This is a simple conversational greeting. According to my instructions:

1. I should avoid emojis unless explicitly requested
2. I should be concise since output is displayed on CLI
3. I should not create unnecessary files or documentation
4. I should be professional and direct
5. I should avoid over-the-top validation or excessive praise

I should respond briefly and professionally, acknowledging the greeting and indicating I'm ready to help. I should NOT use the greeting-responder agent mentioned in the examples since that was just an example of agent usage, not an actual available agent.

I should keep it simple and focused on being helpful with their software engineering needs.

Hello! I'm doing well, thanks. I'm ready to help you with your portfolio project. I can see you're working on the `fix/animation-jank` branch with some recent improvements to animation smoothness.

What would you like to work on today?
